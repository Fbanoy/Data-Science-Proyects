# Data Scientist Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my Data Scientist Portfolio Projects repository! Here you will find a collection of my data science projects and their corresponding code, datasets, and documentation. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my skills and expertise as a data scientist.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
├── Project 1
│   ├── code
│   ├── datasets
│   └── README.md
├── Project 2
│   ├── code
│   ├── datasets
│   └── README.md
├── Project 3
│   ├── code
│   ├── datasets
│   └── README.md
...
└── Project N
    ├── code
    ├── datasets
    └── README.md

    Each project has its own directory, containing the following components:

- **code**: This directory contains the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks used to perform the data analysis, build machine learning models, and create visualizations.
- **datasets**: This directory holds the datasets used in the project. If the dataset is too large to store in the repository, a link or instructions to download it will be provided.
- **README.md**: This file provides a detailed description of the project, including the problem statement, methodology, key findings, and any additional notes or considerations.
